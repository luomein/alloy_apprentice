#Assertion and Counterexample

List the truth table of facts and assertion corresponding to whether counterexample found or not.

It is commonly noted that when there is no counterexample, it may be because of scope too small. However, not so commonly noted, it may be because of the facts are `False`. 

Whenever the facts are `False`, no matter what assertion it is, there would be no counterexample found. See `sample code #2 and #3` below.

    In the case of an assertion, the analysis constraint is the negation of the assertionâ€™s constraint conjoined with the facts of the model. An in- stance is a counterexample: a scenario in which the facts hold but the assertion does not.


## No counterexample found
| facts | assertion | counterexample | sample code |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| True | True | No counterexample found | sample code #1 |
| False | True | No counterexample found | sample code #2 |
| False | False | No counterexample found | sample code #3 |

### sample code #1

```
some sig A {}

fact {
  #A >= 0 // always true
}

assert test{
  #A >= 0 //always true
}

check test
```

### sample code #2

```
some sig A {}

fact {
  #A = 0 // always false
}

assert test{
  #A >= 0 //always true
}

check test
```

### sample code #3

```
some sig A {}

fact {
  #A < 0 // always false
}

assert test{
  #A < 0 //always false
}

check test
```

## Counterexample found
| facts | assertion | counterexample | sample code |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| True | False | Counterexample found | sample code #4 |

### sample code #4

```
some sig A {}

fact {
  #A >= 0 // always true
}

assert test{
  #A < 0 //always false
}

check test
```
