## [Multiplicity](https://alloy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/signatures.html#multiplicity)

> Each relation has a multiplicity, which represents how many atoms it can include. If you do not include a multiplicity, itâ€™s assumed to be `one` for individual relations and `set` for Multirelations.
