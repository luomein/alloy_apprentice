## 3.6 Declarations and Multiplicity Constraints  

### Page 77, "Multiplicities are just a shorthand, and can be replaced by standard constraints."

## 5.2 Instances, Examples, and Counterexamples

### Page 144, "In the case of an assertion, the analysis constraint is the negation of the assertionâ€™s constraint conjoined with the facts of the model. An instance is a counterexample: a scenario in which the facts hold but the assertion does not."
